                      <h3>Code for America Brigade</h3>
                        <p>Louisville’s Code for America Brigade was founded in December of 2012 by Michael Schnuerle after partnering with Louisville Metro since 2011 to open crime, restaurant, and permit data, creating interactive maps for the city, and advising on the city’s open data portal launch in October 2011.</p>

                      <p>On September 2013, the Civic Data Alliance was created by Patrick Smith, Bret Walker, Chris Harrell and Michael Schnuerle to be a voice for citizens. The CDA was merged with the Louisville Brigade in May 2014 when it became a Member CfA Brigade.</p>

                      <p>In December 2014 we reached official Brigade status with Code for America. As of June 2015, over 300 people and volunteers have participated in our hackathons, meetups, and events. Thank you! We’ve had 14 meetups, run 7 hackathons, worked on 29 civic public projects, and donated over 6,000 hours of volunteer time to the community!</p>

                        We don’t have money to build a new jail — and we can’t build our way out of this problem anyway. The question becomes: What can we do to significantly reduce the inmate populations while maintaining the safety of our city and the citizens?

                <h2>
                    The 2013 Fellowship in Louisville 
                </h2>
            </header>
            <div class="layout-gutters">
                <p>In 2013, the City of Louisville and Jefferson County Criminal Justice Commission enlisted Code for America to work on criminal justice in the city. At the time, the system was stretched by crowding, budget cuts, and a complicated (often improvised) information technology infrastructure that ties together agencies at both the State and local levels. Led by CIO Beth Niblock and Criminal Justice Commission Director Kim Allen fellows Shaunak Kashyap, Marcin Wichary and Laura Meixell are working to build technological solutions that use data to help the many moving parts of the system better understand how their work drives outcomes for their community.</p>
                <p>During residency, the fellows had an extraordinary opportunity to observe the criminal justice system up close. They rode along in police cars, sat in criminal court, spent late nights at the metro jail to assess current processes, and interviewed public service professionals at all levels. The group was so successful at connecting with the greater community that when they helped plan Louisville’s National Day of Civic Hacking event, more than 60 community members attended.</p>
                <p>As the Fellows learned during their Residency, American criminal justice systems are complicated by design and operate with a decentralized management structure. Elected Judges are state employees while corrections and police departments are funded and managed by local governments. The decisions that dictate who stays in jail and for how long are made by judges and prosecutors who sentence defendants only with reference to that individual’s circumstances. When the jail becomes overcrowded, the Department of Corrections and thereby the Louisville Metro Government faces increased management costs, unsafe conditions, and risks potential legal action or sanctions from the state.</p>
                <p>In Louisville, the Criminal Justice Commission brings together representatives of the partner agencies to discuss issues that affect them all – including overcrowding. Currently, the Criminal Justice Commission has only ad-hoc access to basic data about population, length of stay, bonding and other key statistics that drive outcomes for Metro Corrections. The Jail Population Management Dashboard prepared by the Fellows gives these groups ongoing access to standardized information so they can discuss trends and assess the effects of policy changes. Increased awareness of data from an authoritative source will help the members of the Jail Policy Committee think about their issues analytically and bring greater accountability to interagency dynamics.</p>
                <p>The Jail Population Management Dashboard will provide many visualizations for stakeholders, while also exposing REST APIs with the raw data. In the future, these APIs may be used to access this data in third party applications and will be included in Louisville’s open data portal.</p>
